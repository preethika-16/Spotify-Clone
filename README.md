 # Spotify Clone
Music Streaming Platform - Front-End Clone

Problem Statement:
Modern music streaming platforms like Spotify require an engaging UI, intuitive navigation, and responsive design to offer seamless access to music collections. Building a clone of such platforms using basic web technologies is a practical challenge to strengthen front-end development skills.

Solution:
The Spotify Clone is a front-end replica of the popular Spotify interface, built using HTML and CSS. This project focuses on replicating Spotify's aesthetic layout, including a sidebar menu, music player controls, playlists section, and main content area. With the implementation of Flexbox, Grid, and media queries, the clone delivers a responsive and interactive user experience. Hover effects and transitions add polish to the design, simulating Spotify’s clean, dark-themed UI.

This project is ideal for web developers aiming to build real-world UI components and understand responsive layout strategies.

Features:

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using flexible layout techniques.

Sidebar Navigation: Mimics Spotify’s sidebar with links to Home, Search, Your Library, etc.

Footer Player Layout: Fixed-position mock music player at the bottom with play/pause, next/previous icons.

Dark Theme Aesthetic: Follows Spotify’s signature dark-themed interface for an authentic feel.

Smooth Transitions: Includes hover animations and transitions for enhanced interactivity.

Tech Stack:

HTML – Page structure and content

CSS – Styling, responsiveness, layout control
